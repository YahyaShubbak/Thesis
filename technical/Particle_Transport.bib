  abstract   = {Due to its rising importance in science and technology in recent years, particle tracking in videos presents itself as a tool for successfully acquiring new knowledge in the field of life sciences and physics. Accordingly, different particle tracking methods for various scenarios have been developed. In this article, we present a particle tracking application implemented in Python for, in particular, spherical magnetic particles, including superparamagnetic beads and Janus particles. In the following, we distinguish between two sub-steps in particle tracking, namely the localization of particles in single images and the linking of the extracted particle positions of the subsequent frames into trajectories. We provide an intensity-based localization technique to detect particles and two linking algorithms, which apply either frame-by-frame linking or linear assignment problem solving. Beyond that, we offer helpful tools to preprocess images automatically as well as estimate parameters required for the localization algorithm by utilizing machine learning. As an extra, we have implemented a technique to estimate the current spatial orientation of Janus particles within the x–y-plane. Our framework is readily extendable and easy-to-use as we offer a graphical user interface and a command-line tool. Various output options, such as data frames and videos, ensure further analysis that can be automated. Program summary Program Title: AdaPT CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/xxpnsbv3cs.1 Developer’s repository link: https://git.ies.uni-kassel.de/adapt/adapt Licensing provisions: MPL-2.0 Programming language: Python 3.6 Supplementary material: We provide supplementary material to increase the traceability of the provided example. It consists of an exemplary input video, the corresponding annotated video with tracked particles, a data frame including the tracking information, and a plot displaying the trajectories. Nature of problem: Particle tracking in videos is an important tool for acquiring new knowledge in diverse fields. Several particle tracking methods have been developed for these diverse applications. The presented particle tracking software has been developed for the motion analysis of spherical or close to spherical magnetic particles. Up until now, no easily extensible automated particle tracking software for close to spherical microparticles and their current positioning status is available. Solution method: AdaPT is an extensible, easy-to-use microparticle tracking application developed explicitly for lab on chip applications but easily extensible to other applications and further functionalities. Currently implemented linking algorithms are a frame-by-frame linking approach as well as an approach solving linear assignment problems. In addition to many assistance possibilities for the user in the form of estimates of parameter values through machine learning, we offer the particular option to determine the orientation and rotation of spherical polymer particles with hemispherical metallic caps (Janus particles). The application can be used via console and graphical user interface. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This software requires video data with spherical or close to spherical magnetic particles. It was tested on videos containing spherical superparamagnetic and magnetic Janus particles. Only mobile particles are detected; immobile particles are ignored by the software, reducing the amount of output data considerably. As a unique feature, the spatial orientation within the x–y-plane of Janus particles can be determined. The application has been tested on a variety of two-dimensional particle motion patterns. The latest version of AdaPT can be found here: https://git.ies.uni-kassel.de/adapt/adapt.},

  abstract  = {Magnetically actuated lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technologies have enabled rapid, highly efficient separation of specific biomarkers and cells from complex biological samples. Nonlinear magnetophoresis (NLM) is a technique that uses a microfabricated magnet array (MMA) and a time varying external magnetic field to precisely control the transport of superparamagnetic (SPM) beads on the surface of a chip based on their size and magnetization. We analyze the transport and separation behavior of SPM monomers and dimers on four MMA geometries, i.e., circular, triangular, square and rectangular shaped micromagnets, across a range of external magnetic field rotation frequencies. The measured critical frequency of the SPM beads on an MMA, i.e., the velocity for which the hydrodynamic drag on a bead exceeds the magnetic force, is closely related to the local magnetic flux density landscape on a micromagnet in the presence of an external magnetic field. A set of design criteria has been established for the optimization of MMAs for NLM separation, with particular focus on the shape of the micromagnets forming the array. The square MMA was used to detect a model protein biomarker and gene fragment based on a magnetic bead assembly (MBA) assay. This assay uses ligand functionalized SPM beads to capture and directly detect an analyte through the formation of SPM bead aggregates. These beads aggregates were detected through NLM separation and microscopic analysis resulting in a highly sensitive assay that did not use carrier fluid.},

Using ab initio principles, we show three-dimensional simulations forecasting the controlled movement of microbeads. Simulated aspects of microbead behaviour include the looping and lifting of microbeads around a magnetic circular structure, the flexible bead movement along symmetrically distributed triangular structures, and the dragging of magnetic beads across an array of exchange biased magnetic microstripes. The unidirectional motion of microbeads across a string of oval elements is predicted by simulations and validated experimentally. Each of the simulations matches the experimental results, proving the robustness and accuracy of the applied numerical method. The computer experiments provide details on the particle motion not accessible by experiments. The simulation capabilities prove to be an essential part for the estimation of future lab-on-chip designs.},

  abstract  = {Magnetic separation provides a rapid and efficient means of isolating biomaterials from complex mixtures based on their adsorption on superparamagnetic (SPM) beads. Flow enhanced non-linear magnetophoresis (FNLM) is a high-resolution mode of separation in which hydrodynamic and magnetic fields are controlled with micron resolution to isolate SPM beads with specific physical properties. In this article we demonstrate that a change in the critical frequency of FNLM can be used to identify beads with magnetic susceptibilities between 0.01 and 1.0 with a sensitivity of 0.01 Hz-1. We derived an analytical expression for the critical frequency that explicitly incorporates the magnetic and non-magnetic composition of a complex to be separated. This expression was then applied to two cases involving the detection and separation of biological targets. This study defines the operating principles of FNLM and highlights the potential for using this technique for multiplexing diagnostic assays and isolating rare cell types.},

Here, the influence of the physiological liquid medium on the transport characteristics of functionalized magnetic particles and on the functionality of the coupled protein is studied. These aspects are theoretically modeled and experimentally investigated for prototype superparamagnetic beads, surface-functionalized with green fluorescent protein immersed in buffer solution with different concentrations of a surfactant. The model reports on the tunability of the steady-state particle substrate separation distance to prevent their surface sticking via the choice of surfactant concentration. Experimental and theoretical average velocities are discussed for a ratchet-like particle motion induced by a dynamic external field superposed on a static locally varying magnetic field landscape. The developed model and experiment may serve as a basis for quantitative forecasts on the functionality of magnetic particle transport-based lab-on-chip devices.},

  abstract  = {The ability to trap, manipulate and release single cells on a surface is important both for fundamental studies of cellular processes and for the development of novel lab-on-chip miniaturized tools for biological and medical applications. In this paper we demonstrate how magnetic domain walls generated in micro- and nano-structures fabricated on a chip surface can be used to handle single yeast cells labeled with magnetic beads. In detail, first we show that the proposed approach maintains the microorganism viable, as proven by monitoring the division of labeled yeast cells trapped by domain walls over 16 hours. Moreover, we demonstrate the controlled transport and release of individual yeast cellsvia displacement and annihilation of individual domain walls in micro- and nano-sized magnetic structures. These results pave the way to the implementation of magnetic devices based on domain walls technology in lab-on-chip systems devoted to accurate individual cell trapping and manipulation.},
